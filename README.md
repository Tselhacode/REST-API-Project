"# REST-API-Project" 
created REST-API from scratch on Buddhist Festivals and applied REST methods to query information on these festivals in database created on ROBO 3T of MongoDB.
The database had collections with data objects entailing two pieces of information - name of the festival and the month the festival is celebrated.
